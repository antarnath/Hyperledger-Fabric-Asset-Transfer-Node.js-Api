# Hyperledger-Fabric-Asset-Transfer-Node.js-Api
# ðŸ”— Asset Transfer API with Node.js

**The Asset Transfer Basic Application** features a Node.js backend (using the Fabric SDK). This project demonstrates key asset operations on a blockchain â€” including **creating**, **reading**, **updating**, **transferring**, and **deleting** assets.

The smart contract (`chaincode`) supports the following functions:

- `CreateAsset`
- `ReadAsset`
- `UpdateAsset`
- `DeleteAsset`
- `TransferAsset`

This sample highlights how to interact with a Hyperledger Fabric network through transaction invocation and wallet-based identity management in a simplified development environment.

## ðŸ§° Getting Started

First, clone the official Hyperledger Fabric samples repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git
```
Navigate to the test network directory within your local clone of the fabric-samples repository:
```bash
cd fabric-samples/test-network
```
Started the test network and created the channel with Certificate Authorities using:
```bash
./network.sh up createChannel -ca
```
Deployed the chaincode using:
```bash
./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go -ccl go
```
## ðŸš€ Run the Fabric API
